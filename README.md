# Coursework for Database lab 2021/2022

## 1. Visual-mondial
Querying the mondial database and visualizing the output. To make this project work locally one needs to install postgresql,
download the mondial database and connect to it locally.
## 2. Views and triggers
Implementation of an API for a webshop. To run this project locally, one needs to install postgresql and create an (empty)
database called "shop" and a user called "admin" with the password "admin".

## 3. Network dissection
Analyzing data from the [network dissection](http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/) paper published by MIT to answer the question
if neural networks actually look at the region in the picture where the object is classified (e.g. are the neurons activated
by the area around the football when the neural network detects a football?)
